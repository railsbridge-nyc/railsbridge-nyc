        %h2 FAQ
        %dl
          %dt Q: Do I have to attend the Installfest?
          %dd
            A: Yes! The Installfest is a crucial part of the
            weekend, even if you’ve already gone through the
            instructions independently. There are a ton of moving
            parts when setting up a development environment, and the
            reason that we’re able to get through the curriculum on
            Saturday is that every single student has had their dev
            environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for
            their successes. There are also enough changing parts that
            even if you’ve been to a workshop in the past, you should
            attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this
            stuff changes almost constantly.
          %dt Q: Do I really have to attend the Installfest?
          %dd
            A: Yes, really. There will be pizza, we promise. And
            fun people to talk to. And you don’t have to be there very
            long if you’ve already gotten through all the steps. (But
            if you haven’t gotten through all the steps ahead of time,
            please come early in the evening, because an install can
            take a few hours depending on what hiccups we get to work
            through.)
