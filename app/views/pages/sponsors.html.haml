          %h2 What is a RailsBridge workshop?
          %p
            RailsBridge works to make tech more diverse and open by
            providing free training and networking opportunities to
            underrepresented groups. We teach Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML
            and CSS, and plan to add iOS, Git, and JavaScript to our
            stable of open-source curricula.
          %p
            A typical workshop is 1.5 days, beginning with a Friday
            evening “Installfest” where we get all the necessary
            technologies installed on the students’ laptops, and
            a Saturday workshop focused on demystifying the topic at
            hand and building something the student can share, be it
            a static website, a simple Rails app, or a Ruby script that
            prints “100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.”
          %p
            The attitude at a RailsBridge workshop is palpably
            encouraging for all levels of programmers. Every workshops
            sees students with a wide range of backgrounds, from
            professional developers and QA engineers interested in
            learning Rails to total novices working with the command
            line for the very first time. Workshop organizers, teachers
            and TAs all volunteer their time and expertise, creating an
            environment where students feel comfortable taking risks and
            asking questions.
          %h2 How do the workshops make a difference?
          %p
            The benefits of attending a workshop as a student are
            fairly self-evident: free training in a very in-demand
            technology, a welcoming and accepting environment, and the
            opportunity to connect with professional developers. For new
            programmers, the affirmation that students receive can be
            the difference between forever being intimidated by
            computers (or programmers themselves) and feeling confident
            enough to dive into tech. Many of the participants have
            experience programming or hold a CS degree but have dropped
            out of the field. A quick and practical introduction to
            a popular new language and framework can jumpstart a career
            shift.
          %p
            Workshop students aren't the only ones learning, though.
            Seasoned developers join the RailsBridge community and learn
            to be more empathetic, deepen their knowledge of their
            craft, and importantly, challenge their subconscious
            preconceptions of what a programmer looks like.
          %p
            Our process and curriculum are emphatically open source,
            so that we can create a distributed network of coders who
            value teaching and learners who become teachers. We are
            dedicated to doing whatever it takes so that the makers of
            technology are reflective of the people in our society.
          %h2 Why does RailsBridge need sponsorship?
          %p
            Accessibility is a chief priority for RailsBridge, and
            we’ve found that providing free food, drinks, supplies, and
            childcare allows our students and volunteers to fully commit
            to the task of learning and educating. Since our workshops
            do not charge tuition, we seek monetary and in-kind
            donations to cover those substantial costs.
          %p
            In San Francisco, we’re fortunate to find most companies
            who host workshops are willing to also provide foods and
            drinks for the workshop as well. Our geographic expansion
            has increased the need for funds to support workshops in
            places where Ruby on Rails is less well-known by local
            businesses. Organizers in new communities are already busy
            recruiting volunteers and students — we want to take the
            challenge of fundraising off of their plates wherever
            possible.
          %h2
            How can I convince my [insert decision maker here] that
            my company/organization should support RailsBridge?
          %p
            Supporting RailsBridge has the long-term benefit of
            contributing to increased diversity in tech (which leads to
            more productive and creative teams, for one). But supporting
            RailsBridge also has more immediate benefits, in particular,
            increasing your organization’s visibility within the Rails
            community. By sponsoring RailsBridge, you are publicly
            demonstrating to professional and future developers that
            your organization values diversity, openness, and
            excellence.
          %h2 Okay, I’m convinced. Where do I send the check?
